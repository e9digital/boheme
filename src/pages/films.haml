%h2 Synopsis

%p
  Rosario Dawson co-stars with Rebekah Paltrow and Sean Lennon in Awake, an original short about a woman's journey from the depths of pain and hopelessness into to a world of clarity and light. Ara, having witnessed more horror then she can cope with, has lost all meaning in life until a very close friend and a mystical sage screw her head on right. Spanning the spectrum from profoundly serious to quirky and comical, Awake sets out to show us that despite the magnitude of our pain, there is always a bigger picture, we just need to be able to see it.
