%h2 Synopsis

%p
  Rosario Dawson co-stars with Rebekah Paltrow and Sean Lennon in <em>Awake</em>, an original short about a woman's journey from the depths of pain and hopelessness into a world of clarity and light. Ara (Paltrow), having witnessed more horror then she can cope with, has lost all meaning in life until a very close friend (Dawson) and a mystical sage (Lennon) screw her head on right. Spanning the spectrum from profoundly serious to quirky and comical, <em>Awake</em> sets out to show us that despite the magnitude of our pain, there is always a bigger picture, we just need to be able to see it.
