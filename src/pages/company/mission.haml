  Boh√®me films was founded in 2010 with the intention of creating socially relevant and spiritually progressive films. With a long standing passion in bettering the world mixed with a profound awareness of the impact movies can have on audiences, we have chosen to create commercially popular films that captivate people and inspire them to grow.
